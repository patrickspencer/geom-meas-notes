Geometric Measure Theory Notes
==============================

These are notes taken at the University of Missouri Columbia during the Fall
2014 semester for the class Math 8302 - Topics in Harmonic Analysis -
Introduction to Geomtric Measure Theory and Quantitative Rectifiability.

If you don't want to deal with git you can download the [precompiled pdf file](http://github.com/patrickspencer/geom-meas-notes/blob/master/main.pdf?raw=truef)
or a [zip file](http://github.com/patrickspencer/geom-meas-notes/archive/master.zip)
containing all the source files.


Compiling
---------

Each chapter is a file in the folder called 'content'. The file main.tex
includes all the other chapters so compile that file in order to get the whole
document. You can compile it as you would any other tex documents. It relies
on the following tex packages: amssymb, amsmath, amsthm, mathtools, enumerate,
glossaries, color, hyperref, geometry, mathrsfs, eucal, lmodern.

Contributing
------------

I would love for other people to contribute to this document. If you know git
you can send me a pull request through GitHub. If you don't know git then just
email me whatever additions you would like me to add and I'll add your name to
the contributors.
